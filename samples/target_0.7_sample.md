The steam always hangs too thick in the old bathhouse, a suffocating blanket that clings to your skin even before you step into the water. I came seeking the quiet, the heat, the way the old place seemed to swallow your thoughts whole. The tiles are cracked and stained, the air thick with the ghosts of a hundred other bathers, their sighs echoing in the tiled chamber. I lowered myself into the largest pool, the water unnervingly still, its surface like dark glass reflecting only the warped ceiling beams and the dim, flickering bulb overhead. For a moment, it was just me, the heat, and the oppressive silence broken only by the distant drip of water from a rusted pipe.

Then, something brushed my ankle beneath the surface. Not a stray leaf or a piece of debris, but something solid, cold, and deliberate. I froze, heart hammering against my ribs, straining to see through the murky water. Nothing moved. The steam swirled, obscuring the edges of the pool. I told myself it was just the current, my own imagination playing tricks in the heat. But then, it happened again, higher this time, a cold, bony touch sliding up my calf, leaving a trail of goosebites that felt like frost. A low, gurgling sigh seemed to rise from the drain itself, a sound that wasn't water, but something ancient and drowned.

I scrambled out of the pool, water streaming from my body, my breath coming in ragged gasps. The air felt suddenly frigid, the steam retreating as if fleeing from me. I grabbed my towel, my hands shaking, and backed towards the changing room. As I fumbled with the lock, I glanced back at the empty pool. The surface was perfectly still again, but the water looked darker, deeper, somehow *hungrier*. And beneath the surface, just for a second, I thought I saw a shape, pale and distorted, rising from the depths, its eyes fixed on me. I slammed the door shut, leaning against it, the cold wood a poor shield against the certainty that I wasn't alone, and that the bathhouse had claimed another bather for its silent, steamy depths.
