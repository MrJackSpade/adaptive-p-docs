The steam hit me first, thick and cloying, smelling of damp stone and something else… something faintly sweet, like rotting flowers. I’d ignored the warnings, the locals’ nervous glances towards the old bath-house perched on the cliff edge. It was supposed to be abandoned, but the promise of solitude, of the ancient mineral springs, was too tempting. The changing rooms were skeletal, wood groaning under my weight. Stepping into the main pool chamber, the air was unnervingly still, the only sound the slow, rhythmic *drip… drip… drip* from a cracked pipe high above. The water itself was unnervingly warm, almost too hot, but I sank into it anyway, the mineral-rich liquid clinging to my skin like a second layer. That’s when I felt the first shift – not a current, but a *presence*, a subtle thickening of the water around my ankles, as if something vast and ancient was stirring beneath the surface.

The steam began to coalesce, twisting into shapes that weren’t quite human, figures with elongated limbs and featureless faces that dissolved back into mist the moment I tried to focus. A whisper slithered through the humid air, not words, but a feeling, a cold dread that seeped into my bones despite the heat. "Leave," it seemed to sigh, the sound vibrating through the water itself. I told myself it was just the acoustics, the old plumbing playing tricks. But then the temperature plummeted, not gradually, but in a sudden, shocking wave that made my teeth chatter. The water felt… *wrong*. It wasn’t cold; it was *hungry*. It pressed against me with a new weight, a thousand tiny, insistent hands pulling me down, deeper into the suffocating embrace of the pool. The dripping stopped. The silence became absolute, broken only by the frantic hammering of my own heart against my ribs.

Panic finally clawed its way through the fog of denial. I tried to push myself up, but the water resisted, thick as oil, clinging to me like a lover’s desperate grip. The steam swirled violently, forming a vortex directly above me, and in its center, I saw it – not a face, but an absence of light, a void that pulsed with a cold, ancient hunger. The whisper returned, louder this time, a chorus of voices woven from the stone and the water itself: *Stay. Rest. Become one.* The drain at the bottom of the pool glistened, not with reflected light, but with a wet, organic sheen, and it seemed to *breathe*, opening and closing like a slow, deliberate mouth. The water wasn’t just haunted; it was *alive*, and it had decided I was its next meal. I screamed, but the sound was swallowed whole by the suffocating steam and the endless, hungry dark.
