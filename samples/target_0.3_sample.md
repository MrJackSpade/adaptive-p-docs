The air inside the Old Stearns Bathhouse hangs thick with dampness and something else – the sour, cloying smell of stagnant water and old pipe resin that seems to coat your lungs like a cold slime. My guide’s cheerful warnings about ‘quirks of old buildings’ feel flimsy the moment he vanishes behind a curtain of steam near the men's section, leaving only the relentless hiss of dripping faucets and the low groan of the ancient pipes. The vast tiled room stretches into gloomy shadow beyond the circle of weak, buzzing overhead lights. Steam clings to my skin like cold, damp cobwebs as I edge towards a lone empty bench near a cracked porcelain tub. It feels too silent here, too still.

A sudden, violent clatter echoes from somewhere deeper in the bath-house – metal clattering on stone. I jump, my heart thudding a heavy drumbeat against my ribs. “Hello?” The word hangs, swallowed by the steam without a response, yet another drip begins somewhere close, impossibly close to where I stand. Then I hear it, a low whispering sound woven into the hissing of steam – a voiceless murmur like damp rags being shuffled over tiles, just at the edge of hearing, right behind my back. My blood turns to icy slurry as a cold draft, utterly impossible in the humid heat, sweeps over the nape of my neck.

Panic floods my system as I spin towards the whisper, but the bench where I’d sat is suddenly empty. Instead, standing where the empty tub was, a shape forms within the densest steam – the faint outline of a hunched figure, dripping dark water that stains the grey tiles black around its formless feet. The hissing whisper intensifies into a sibilant chuckle, directly in my ear. The last thing I see is a swirling cloud of steam condensing on my own arm into the wet, icy fingerprints of something that was never there. Then, the cold darkness wraps around me like a drowning sheet.
