The first time I saw it, I dismissed the whispers as just the old pipes settling, the sighs of the ancient steam system. But the bath-house, with its tiled walls stained dark by decades of moisture, held a deeper chill the air itself couldn't account for. The water, once clear and inviting, now felt thin and cold against my skin even as the steam rose, carrying the scent of mildew and something older, like wet earth disturbed after a long burial. Shadows clung to the corners of the vast changing room, refusing to yield completely even under the flickering fluorescent lights overhead. That’s when the whispers started again, not from the pipes this time, but from the empty cubicles beside me, low and wet and sounding like voices drowning in deep water.

The second visit was worse. The steam was unnaturally dense, clinging like a wet shroud and muffling the world outside. I could feel eyes on my back in the steam-filled pool, not just the imagined stares of other patrons, but a focused, ancient malevolence that seemed to seep from the damp tiles. The water rippled without a breeze, the surface disturbed by something unseen just below, dark and shapeless. I caught fleeting glimpses in the foggy mirrors – distorted figures that dissolved when I blinked, leaving only a lingering impression of decay and hollow eyes. A cold spot, unnaturally so, formed directly beneath me in the water, making me gasp as my own warmth was sucked away, replaced by something that felt distinctly like a touch.

I fled the third time. The whispers had become a chorus of drowned pleas, rising and falling like the tide in the tiled chamber. As I scrambled out of the main pool, dripping and shaking, I saw them: faint, wet handprints pressed against the glass of the sauna door from the inside. They hadn’t been there when I entered. Then came the sound, not from outside, but from within my own mind, clear and cold: *"You belong here now. The water remembers."* The lock clicked shut on the sauna door with a final, echoing thud. Through the frosted glass, a shape began to coalesce in the dense, white steam, a silhouette too tall, too gaunt to be human. The water in the drain beside my feet began to bubble darkly, as if pulling something up from the depths below.
